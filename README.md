# Crimes_against_women
This is a data visualization project made using Tableau. Here, we analyze the data related to crimes against women from year 2000-2014.
We have data for all the states within India excluding the union territories. Using this, we find out which are the states showing poor trends and high rates of crimes against women all these years.
